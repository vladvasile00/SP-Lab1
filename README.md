Design Patterns - Lab 1
Setting up the working environment
Goal
We need to prepare our development environment to get started in our design patterns
journey. Because we are preparing to be professional software engineers we need to
get familiar with some of the standard tools used in the industry. Any software engineer
should be able to use a source control system (SCM) and an Integrated
Development Environment (IDE).
